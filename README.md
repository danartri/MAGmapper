# MAGmapper
## Basic Idea
A Videomapper based on three.js
Should run on any plattform using Chrome or Firefox.

Maybe we should use [maptasticjs](https://github.com/glowbox/maptasticjs).
Looks great and has the basic functions.

Now we have to figure out if it is possible to load a video with omxplayer within a website and this tool,
so we could gain fully HW support on RPi and could use the sync script to sync multiple players.

These guys are talking about [omxplayer support](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=40860)
but have no idea if this supports three.js and distorsion. Try implementation with this:

<br>
    <iframe src="file:///homepage.html?cmd=omxplayer%20--win%200,0,1920,1080%20/home/pi/video.mp4" width="2px" height="2px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</br>
Could not implement omxplayer within an iframe so far.
But with newest chromium browser we have full HW support for playing videos.
FullHD movies seem to run smooth in the browser, we need to figure out how to loop (looping can be achieved when the video is set on a seperate html page and then in the iframe src= tag of the mapper is this page loaded.
With this solution we could also choose to load the video files from storge with the input type="file" tag, as seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/dsbonev/cCCZ2/embedded/result,js,html,css/
and for syncing we would have to check this approach: https://bocoup.com/blog/html5-video-synchronizing-playback-of-two-videos.



These guys do [map](http://www.floz.fr/Tsuki8Projection-mapping-in-Japan) with three.js. 

- [Testimage](https://pocketvj.com/video/PVJ_Testscreen.png)
- [Testvideo](https://pocketvj.com/video/PVJ_Testvideo2018.mp4)


Its in the very early developement stage, reached so far:

- Basic understandment of Three.js structure.
- Draggable 3d object in browser.

## Next Steps:

- Change BoxGeometry to [BufferGeometryquad](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_buffergeometry_indexed) style surface like in the example here:
- Make corners dragable, so when mouse + click on a corner, you can move its position
- Add circular markers to corners to see them better, something like the red dotÂ [here](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_interactive_lines)
- Load custom [Textures](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/textures/VideoTexture) (images, image folders, videos)
- Adding a [video](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37884013/adding-video-as-texture-in-three-js) to a texture
- Test spline planes, is it possible to use bezier handles on [webgl_geometry_nurbs](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_geometry_nurbs)

## Milestones
### Milestone1:
- Functional prototype of a quad surface with a video texture which can be distorted with dragging the corners. Corners get higlighted when mouse is near them (if possible).


### Milestone2:
- Add keyboard shortcuts (or overlay menu) to step thru video/image sources (changing sources).
- Shortcut to save the actual comp and to create a new comp.
- Define input texture size (similar to texture mode in ofxpimapper).

### Milestone3:
- Keyboard shortcut to create new quad and delete selected quad.
- Add more shapes like triangles, circles.
- Check if it is possible to grid up existing textures (like Warp function in  Mapio).
- Audio support (HDMI, Jack, Alsa).

### Milestone4:
- Remote control from another webbrowser (serving with lighttp, websockets, python server), the most lightweight version as possible.

### Milestone5:
- Play/Pause
- Adjust brightness contrast of input texture.
- Image slide show with directory listener, blending, timer.
- Webcam, RPi cam input.

### Milestone6:
- Add [generators](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=partic#canvas_particles_sprites)
- Audio reactive FX.
- Sync various players with each other, or source from tcp-server.
