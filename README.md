# MAGmapper
## Basic Idea
A Videomapper based on three.js
Should run on any plattform using Chrome or Firefox.

Maybe we should use [maptasticjs](https://github.com/glowbox/maptasticjs).
Looks great and has the basic functions.

Now we have to figure out if it is possible to load a video with omxplayer within a website and this tool,
so we could gain fully HW support on RPi and could use the sync script to sync multiple players.

These guys are talking about [omxplayer support](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=40860)
but have no idea if this supports three.js and distorsion. Try implementation with this:

<br>
    <iframe src="file:///homepage.html?cmd=omxplayer%20--win%200,0,1920,1080%20/home/pi/video.mp4" width="2px" height="2px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</br>

If there is no way to gain Video HW support thru iframe and omxplayer, we have to switch to [this](https://forums.resin.io/t/fullscreen-webkit-browser-with-hw-accelerated-css-webgl-and-html5-video-on-the-raspberrypi-3/741) operation system for full WebGL HW support.


These guys do [map](http://www.floz.fr/Tsuki8Projection-mapping-in-Japan) with three.js.

- [Testvideo](https://pocketvj.com/video/PVJ_Testvideo2018.mp4)


Its in the very early developement stage, reached so far:

- Basic understandment of Three.js structure.
- Draggable 3d object in browser.

## Next Steps:

- Change BoxGeometry to [BufferGeometryquad](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_buffergeometry_indexed) style surface like in the example here:
- Make corners dragable, so when mouse + click on a corner, you can move its position
- Add circular markers to corners to see them better, something like the red dotÂ [here](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_interactive_lines)
- Load custom [Textures](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/textures/VideoTexture) (images, image folders, videos)
- Adding a [video](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37884013/adding-video-as-texture-in-three-js) to a texture
- Test spline planes, is it possible to use bezier handles on [webgl_geometry_nurbs](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_geometry_nurbs)

## Milestones
### Milestone1:
- Functional prototype of a quad surface with a video texture which can be distorted with dragging the corners. Corners get higlighted when mouse is near them (if possible).


### Milestone2:
- Add keyboard shortcuts (or overlay menu) to step thru video/image sources (changing sources).
- Shortcut to save the actual comp and to create a new comp.
- Define input texture size (similar to texture mode in ofxpimapper).

### Milestone3:
- Keyboard shortcut to create new quad and delete selected quad.
- Add more shapes like triangles, circles.
- Check if it is possible to grid up existing textures (like Warp function in  Mapio).
- Audio support (HDMI, Jack, Alsa).

### Milestone4:
- Remote control from another webbrowser (serving with lighttp, websockets, python server), the most lightweight version as possible.

### Milestone5:
- Play/Pause
- Adjust brightness contrast of input texture.
- Image slide show with directory listener, blending, timer.
- Webcam, RPi cam input.

### Milestone6:
- Add [generators](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=partic#canvas_particles_sprites)
- Audio reactive FX.
- Sync various players with each other, or source from tcp-server.
